# OTP Splitter

Basic useful feature list:

 * Split the keys from the dumped OTP bin to individual bin files that has the appropriate key in it for each key, as outlined over on [the WiiUBrew site](http://wiiubrew.org/wiki/Hardware/OTP) and the help of the WiiUBru team.

This is my first "real" experiment in Python and Hexadecimal, so it's likely not going to be super pretty or "clean".

Please do feel free to throw Pull Requests at me to fix any mistakes that I may have made.

### BIG thanks goes to (in order of when I remembered their name):

 * vgmoose (Who got me started on putting this as a python script, so thanks man!)
 * Dimok
 * QuarkTheAwesome
 * Fix94
 * supster131
 * kanye_west
 * Those that put in useful pull requests, if anyone does.
 * Anyone else that cares enough to nag me about it in the IRC.
