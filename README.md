# OTP Splitter

To my knowledge, this only works on the Linux command line at the moment. If you test this on a Windows python2 instance, please do let me know.

Basic feature list:

 * Take the keys from a dumped Wii U OTP, as outlined on [the WiiUBrew site](http://wiiubrew.org/wiki/Hardware/OTP) and the help of the WiiUBru team.

This is my first "real" experiment in Python and Hexadecimal, so it's notsuper pretty to read or look at.

Please do feel free to throw Pull Requests at me to fix any mistakes that you think I have made.

### BIG thanks goes to (in order of when I remembered their name):

 * Dimok, for the original [OTP2SD](https://github.com/dimok789/otp2sd_dumper) homebrew that started me on this
 	*For the unofficial GBATemp thread: [Click Here](http://gbatemp.net/threads/otp2sd-by-dimok.447353/)
 * The WiiUBru team that got the list up in the first place, and the ones that put up with my complaining about writing this.
 * Audiosurf for helping shorten the script itself in quite a few places.
 * Truedread for supplying an OTP.bin for me to test with.
 * Anyone else that cares enough to nag me about it in the WiiUBru IRC.
 * My friends that I've complained about this to, that aren't in the WiiUBru IRC.
